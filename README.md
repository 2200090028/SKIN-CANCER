ðŸ”¬ Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning
This project applies a deep learning approach to classify skin cancer images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The major steps include:

Data Preprocessing:

Images are read and loaded into a structured format using dataframes.

An ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation and normalization.

Samples from the training data are visualized to understand the distribution and quality.

Model Design:

A CNN model is built using TensorFlow/Keras.

The model consists of convolutional layers, activation functions (like ReLU), pooling layers, and dense layers for classification.

Training:

The model is trained on labeled image data.

Metrics like accuracy and loss are monitored during training.

Graphs and summaries are used to evaluate training performance.

Evaluation:

The trained model is tested on validation data.

A confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment:

The model is saved and later loaded for predictions.

It is also converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format for lightweight deployment on mobile or embedded systems.
